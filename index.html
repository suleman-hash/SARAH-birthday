      <p>"Sarah, you are the most beautiful part of my life — not just because of how you look, but because of how you make me feel.</p>
      <p>"If I could write every reason I love you on the stars, the night sky would never be dark again. You’re the melody in my silence, the warmth in my winter, and the forever I didn’t know I was searching for. I hope this little space I made for you brings a smile to your face — just like you bring to mine every single day..</p>
      <p>You're kind, strong, and beautiful inside and out.</p>

   <h2>Dreams to come true 💖</h2>
   <p>"I’ve always believed that dreams are whispers from the heart — soft, impossible things we keep hidden. But then I met you, and suddenly, my biggest dream began to feel real. With every smile, every moment, you’ve shown me a life I never knew I could have. A life where we laugh together, grow together, and one day, walk hand in hand down the aisle, promising forever — not just in words, but in soul. I don’t know where time will take us, but I know the destination I dream of: a home filled with love, laughter, and you by my side, as my wife.</p>
   <p>With all my love,</p>
   <strong> Yours forever,
