    <h2>Reasons I Love You 💌</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You make the world brighter just by being in it.</li>
      <li>Your smile is my favorite thing to see.</li>
      <li>You're kind, strong, and beautiful inside and out.</li>
      <li>"Sarah, you are the most beautiful part of my life — not just because of how you look, but because of how you make me feel. Every moment with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. Your smile, your voice, your heart — they’ve become my favorite things in this world. I built this small corner of the internet just for you, to remind you how deeply and endlessly you are loved. Happy Birthday, my princess. I hope this day brings you the happiness you've given me every day."</li>
      <li>"From the very first moment we met, I knew you were something extraordinary. You’ve filled my life with laughter, love, and a kind of peace I never knew I needed. You make ordinary days feel magical, and every heartbeat feels lighter when it's with you. This is just a small gift, but it carries all of me — every word, every picture, every second of this page belongs to you, Sarah.</li>
      <li>"If I could write every reason I love you on the stars, the night sky would never be dark again. You’re the melody in my silence, the warmth in my winter, and the forever I didn’t know I was searching for. I hope this little space I made for you brings a smile to your face — just like you bring to mine every single day.</li>
     <li>"Sarah, there’s so much I want to say, but most of all — thank you. Thank you for being patient with me, for loving me in your quiet and beautiful ways, and for simply being you. I made this to remind you that someone out there is thinking of you always, loving you endlessly, and believing in 'us' no matter what."</li> 
      <li>"This is just the beginning of what I want to build with you — not just pages on a screen, but memories, journeys, and dreams that last a lifetime. Every picture, every reason, every word here is a step toward a future I see only with you. Happy birthday, love. I hope this brings you even a fraction of the joy you bring me."     </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sarah, on this special day, I just want to say how lucky I am to have you. You are my light, my joy, and my everything. May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring to my life every day.</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p><strong>
    “Even in lifetimes beyond this one, I’ll still choose you. Again and again.”
    Yours forever 💖
