    <h2>Reasons I Love You 💌</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"Sarah, you are the most beautiful part of my life — not just because of how you look, but because of how you make me feel.</li>
      <li>>"If I could write every reason I love you on the stars, the night sky would never be dark again. You’re the melody in my silence, the warmth in my winter, and the forever I didn’t know I was searching for. I hope this little space I made for you brings a smile to your face — just like you bring to mine every single day..</li>
      <li>You're kind, strong, and beautiful inside and out.</li>

    <p>Sarah, on this special day, I just want to say how lucky I am to have you. You are my light, my joy, and my everything. May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring to my life every day.</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p><strong>

 <section class="dreams">
   <h2>Dreams to come true 💖</h2>
    <p>"I’ve always believed that dreams are whispers from the heart — soft, impossible things we keep hidden. But then I met you, and suddenly, my biggest dream began to feel real. With every smile, every moment, you’ve shown me a life I never knew I could have. A life where we laugh together, grow together, and one day, walk hand in hand down the aisle, promising forever — not just in words, but in soul. I don’t know where time will take us, but I know the destination I dream of: a home filled with love, laughter, and you by my side, as my wife.</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
   <strong> Yours forever, 
     S U L E M A N ⸙ </strong></p>
